# CronusMaxPlus_cSharp
A C# demonstration project to show how to use the CronusMaxPlus API

This is a simple wrapper that demonstrates loading the API, then talking to it using standard xinput gamepad commands. No third party plugins required.

If you require more information, check the CronusMaxPlus API or check the forum for more information.
